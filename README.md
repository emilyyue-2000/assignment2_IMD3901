For my project i had 3 objects placed on the scene with an enviornement I had them all
do unique things like, rotate on click, make music on click, as well as scale on click.
I also added a box that displayed text when hovered over it with the cursor. I also had background music.

What was challeneging was getting the animations to work. I tried a bunch of
different methods to get it to work. I also tried to add in a new script to add a new
function into my code to use, but that didnt work either. I got it to work eventually. I also
had a bit of throuble with the directory. At first I had my asset folder outside my public one,
and i couldnt access my photos and music.

After i got my assets to work, having the objects to have photos
and music on click was much faster and esier than i expected.
