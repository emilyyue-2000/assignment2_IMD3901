For my project i had 3 objects placed on the scene with an enviornement
I had them all do unique things like, rotate on clikc, make nouse on click,
as well as scale on click. I also added a box that displayed text when hovered over it 
witht he curor. I also had background music.

What was challeneging was ghetting the animations to work. I tried a bunch of
different methods to get it to work. I also tried to add in a new script to add a nuew
function into my code to use, but that didnt work either. I got it to work eventually. 
I also had a bit of throuble with the directory. At first I had my asset folder
outside my public one, and i couldnt access my photos and music.

After i got my assets to work, having the objects to have photos and music on click 
was muh faster and esier than i expected.
